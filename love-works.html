      <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
      <p>Employee engagement is declining. <b>U.S. employee engagement fell to an 11-year low at the end of 2024, with only 31% of employees reporting they were engaged.</b> This is down from a pandemic-era high of <b>36% in 2020</b>.</p>
      <p><b>Trust in leadership has dropped sharply.</b> A May 2025 poll found that only <b>20% of U.S. employees “strongly agree”</b> they trust the leadership of their organization. Yet more than <b>70% of workers</b> say they want their work to have meaning—not just a paycheck.</p>
      <p>For centuries, most work was done with our <b>hands and feet</b> — building, moving, repairing — with clear paths of mastery: apprenticeships, residencies, certifications. Success or failure was visible. Your weld held or it didn’t. The surgery healed or it didn’t.</p>
      <p>Today, most work is done with our <b>mouths and ears</b> — communicating, persuading, listening, connecting. Data shows <b>62% of all jobs</b> now depend primarily on human-to-human communication, and that percentage is rising. For leaders, it’s closer to <b>80–90%</b>.</p>
      <p><strong>Love Works reframes communication. It’s not a “soft skill.” It’s the hardest and most essential leadership skill. When leaders learn to listen, connect, and communicate with care, they create organizations where people feel seen, heard, and valued.</strong></p>

            <li><b>Credible</b> — follow through on commitments; build trust with consistency.</li>

      <h2>Three Tools</h2>
      <p><em>People don’t need answers as much as they need presence.</em> They don’t need you to rescue them — they need someone to believe in them. Encouragement means to give courage. And giving courage often begins with a good question, not a great answer — then showing that you are there with them and that you believe they can do it.</p>

      <h3>1. 1-on-1s (Intentional Connection)</h3>
      <p>Structured and <b>scheduled</b> monthly or biweekly conversations where leaders show care and alignment.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“What’s top of mind for you right now?”</li>
        <li>“What roadblocks or fears are you facing?”</li>
        <li>“What do you plan to do?”</li>
        <li>“Is there anything you need from me?”</li>
        <li>“How are YOU doing?”</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. CHaD Conversations (Caring. Honest. And Direct.)</h3>
      <p><b>Caring</b> — words are grounded in love and compassion — for them, not your ego.<br>
      <b>Honest</b> — speaking the truth — facts, not assumptions.<br>
      <b>Direct</b> — no sugarcoating or side-stepping. Get to the heart of the issue.</p>
      <p>Doing all three well — <b>Caring, Honest, and Direct</b> — takes intentionality. It takes prayer, practice, and presence.<br><em>Remember: Give peace, not a piece.</em></p>

      <h3>3. ICU / ICNU Moments (Recognition &amp; Potential)</h3>
      <p>Small but powerful ways to make people feel seen and valued.</p>
      <p><b>ICU (I See You):</b> Noticing someone as a person, not just their work.<br>
      “Hey, I see you’re a Bulls fan — did you catch the game last night?”<br>
      “I noticed you stayed late to finish that project — thank you.”</p>
      <p><b>ICNU (I See in You):</b> Identifying a strength or potential you see in them.<br>
      “I see in you the ability to lead projects like this more often. You bring people together.”<br>
      “When you voice your ideas, they’re great — I encourage you to speak up more. I really value your perspective.”</p>
