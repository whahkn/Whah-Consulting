      <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
      <p>Employee engagement is declining. U.S. employee engagement fell to an 11-year low at the end of 2024, with only 31% of employees reporting they were engaged. This is down from a pandemic-era high of 36% in 2020.</p>
      <p>Trust in leadership has dropped sharply. A May 2025 poll found that only 20% of U.S. employees "strongly agree" they trust the leadership of their organization. Yet more than 70% of workers say they want their work to have meaning—not just a paycheck.</p>
      <p>For centuries, most work was done with our hands and feet — building, moving, repairing — with clear paths of mastery: apprenticeships, residencies, certifications. Success or failure was visible. Your weld held or it didn’t. The surgery healed or it didn’t.</p>
      <p>Today, most work is done with our mouths and ears — communicating, persuading, listening, connecting. Data shows 62% of all jobs now depend primarily on human-to-human communication, and that percentage is rising. For leaders, it’s closer to 80–90%.</p>
      <p><strong>Love Works reframes communication. It’s not a “soft skill.” It’s the hardest and most essential leadership skill. When leaders learn to listen, connect, and communicate with care, they create organizations where people feel seen, heard, and valued.</strong></p>

      <h3>The Communicator’s Responsibility</h3>
      <ul><li>Clear – express expectations and ideas in simple, actionable terms.</li><li>Credible – follow through on commitments; build trust with consistency.</li><li>Connected – speak in ways that reflect care, empathy, and respect.</li></ul>
      <h3>The Listener’s Responsibility</h3>
      <ul><li>Attentive – put distractions aside and give full presence.</li><li>Curious – ask open questions that reveal deeper meaning.</li><li>Willing – engage with humility, ready to learn and adapt.</li></ul>

      <h2>The Three Tools</h2>
      <p>People don’t need answers as much as they need presence. They don’t need you to rescue them — they need someone to believe in them. Encouragement means to give courage. And giving courage often begins with a good question, not a great answer. Then showing that you are there with them and that you believe they can do it.</p>
      <h3>1. 1-on-1s (Intentional Connection)</h3>
      <p>Structured and scheduled monthly or biweekly conversations where leaders show care and alignment.</p>
      <ul><li>“What’s top of mind for you right now?”</li><li>“What roadblocks or fears are you facing?”</li><li>“What do you plan to do?”</li><li>“Is there anything you need from me?”</li><li>“How are YOU doing?”</li></ul>

      <h3>2. CHaD Conversations (Caring. Honest. And Direct.)</h3>
      <p><strong>Caring</strong> – words are grounded in love and compassion — for them, not your ego.<br/>
      <strong>Honest</strong> – speaking the truth — facts, not assumptions.<br/>
      <strong>Direct</strong> – no sugarcoating or side-stepping. Get to the heart of the issue.</p>
      <p>Doing all three well — Caring, Honest, and Direct — takes intentionality. It takes prayer, practice, and presence.<br/><em>Remember: Give peace, not a piece.</em></p>

      <h3>3. ICU / ICNU Moments (Recognition & Potential)</h3>
      <p>Small but powerful ways to make people feel seen and valued.</p>
      <p><strong>ICU (I See You):</strong> Noticing someone as a person, not just their work.<br/>
      “Hey, I see you’re a Bulls fan — did you catch the game last night?”<br/>
      “I noticed you stayed late to finish that project — thank you.”</p>
      <p><strong>ICNU (I See in You):</strong> Identifying a strength or potential you see in them.<br/>
      “I see in you the ability to lead projects like this more often. You bring people together.”<br/>
      “When you voice your ideas, they’re great — I encourage you to speak up more. I really value your perspective.”</p>
